# H2O Plumbing Brand Consistency Fix

## Date: 2025-01-30

### Issue Identified
Multiple pages across the site were using `brand-red` color classes, which is **not part of H2O Plumbing's brand palette**. This created visual inconsistency and conflicted with the company's water/plumbing theme.

### H2O Plumbing Official Brand Colors
As defined in `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css`:

- **Primary:** `brand-cyan` (#00A3D9) - Logo water drop blue
- **Secondary:** `brand-turquoise` (#00b8e6) - Lighter accent
- **Supporting Colors:**
  - `brand-black` (#000000) - Pure black from logo
  - `brand-gray` shades - For text and backgrounds
  - `brand-white` (#FFFFFF)

### Fix Applied
**Global Find & Replace:**
- Replaced all occurrences of `brand-red` with `brand-cyan` across:
  - `/src/app/**/*.tsx` and `*.ts` files
  - `/src/components/**/*.tsx` and `*.ts` files

**Total Changes:** 156+ occurrences fixed

### Files Affected
Major pages updated to use correct branding:
- Commercial services page (`/src/app/commercial/page.tsx`)
- Services overview page (`/src/app/services/page.tsx`)
- About page (`/src/app/about/page.tsx`)
- Contact page (`/src/app/contact/page.tsx`)
- All service detail pages (drain cleaning, water heater, etc.)
- Service area pages
- Blog pages
- All components using color classes

### Visual Impact
**Before:**
- Inconsistent red accents on various pages
- Confusing brand identity
- No cohesion with water/plumbing theme

**After:**
- Consistent cyan branding across entire site
- Professional water-themed visual identity
- Cohesive user experience
- All buttons, links, badges, and accents use H2O's signature cyan

### Components Fixed
- CTA buttons
- Navigation links
- Hero sections
- Service cards
- Trust badges
- Form focus states
- Icon backgrounds
- Gradient backgrounds
- Hover states
- Active states

### Verification
All color references now properly use:
- `text-brand-cyan` for text
- `bg-brand-cyan` for backgrounds
- `border-brand-cyan` for borders
- `hover:bg-brand-cyan-dark` for hover states
- `focus:border-brand-cyan` for focus states

### Recommendations
1. **Never use `brand-red`** - it's not part of the brand
2. Use `brand-cyan` as primary action color
3. Use `brand-turquoise` as secondary/accent
4. Use gray shades for text and backgrounds
5. Maintain consistency across new pages/components
