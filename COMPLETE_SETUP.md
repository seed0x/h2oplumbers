# âœ… Database & Forms - COMPLETE SETUP

## What We Accomplished

### âœ… Database Connected
- **Prisma Postgres** database is connected and working
- Connection URL configured in `.env` and `.env.local`
- All tables created via `npx prisma db push`

### âœ… Forms Saving to Database
1. **Contact Forms** (`/api/contact`) - âœ… WORKING
   - General contact form
   - Service request form
   - Emergency form
   - Construction project form
   - All save to: `customers`, `leads`, `emergency_queue` tables

2. **Booking Form** (`/api/booking`) - âœ… WORKING
   - Saves appointments to database
   - Creates/updates customers
   - Links to services
   - Saves to: `customers`, `appointments` tables

### âœ… Services Configured
- **9 services** added to database
- **16 service areas** (ZIP codes) configured
- Manage via:
  - **Config file**: `src/config/services.ts`
  - **Sync command**: `npm run sync-services`
  - **GUI**: `npm run db:studio` (http://localhost:5555)

### âœ… Files Cleaned Up
- Deleted old file-based booking system (`/api/bookings`)
- Removed file-based admin API
- All forms now use single database system
- No more `data/bookings.json` files

## How to Use
